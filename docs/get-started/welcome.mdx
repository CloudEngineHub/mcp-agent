**mcp-agent is a simple, composable framework to build agents using [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction).**

Anthropic announced 2 foundational updates for AI application developers:

1. [Model Context Protocol](https://www.anthropic.com/news/model-context-protocol) - a standardized interface to let any software be accessible to AI assistants via MCP servers.
2. [Building Effective Agents](https://www.anthropic.com/research/building-effective-agents) - a seminal writeup on simple, composable patterns for building production-ready AI agents.

`mcp-agent` puts these two foundational pieces into an AI application framework:

1. It handles the pesky business of managing the lifecycle of MCP server connections so you don't have to.
2. It implements every pattern described in Building Effective Agents, and does so in a _composable_ way, allowing you to chain these patterns together.
3. **Bonus**: It implements [OpenAI's Swarm](https://github.com/openai/swarm) pattern for multi-agent orchestration, but in a model-agnostic way.

```python {1}
import asyncio
from mcp_agent.app import MCPApp
from mcp_agent.agents.agent import Agent
from mcp_agent.workflows.llm.augmented_llm_openai import OpenAIAugmentedLLM

app = MCPApp(name="example_agent")

async def main():
    async with app.run() as mcp_agent_app:
        # Create agent with MCP server access
        agent = Agent(
            name="researcher",
            instruction="Research topics using available tools",
            server_names=["fetch", "filesystem"]
        )

        async with agent:
            # Attach LLM for interaction
            llm = await agent.attach_llm(OpenAIAugmentedLLM)

            # Agent can now use MCP server tools
            result = await llm.generate_str("Research quantum computing")
            print(result)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

## Beyond Basic Agents

mcp-agent is the simplest and easiest way to build robust agent applications. Much like MCP, this project is in early development.

## Key Features

mcp-agent handles the complex orchestration details so you can focus on building. In most cases, defining an agent and its instructions is all you need ‚Äî mcp-agent handles the rest.

üöÄ **Simple & Composable**: Build complex workflows by chaining simple patterns

üîå **MCP-Native**: Works seamlessly with any MCP server

üéØ **Pattern Library**: Implements all patterns from Anthropic's Building Effective Agents

ü§ñ **Multi-Agent**: Support for agent collaboration and handoffs

‚ö° **Durable Execution**: Built-in support for long-running workflows with Temporal

üîç **Complete**: Everything for production ‚Äî authentication, observability, deployment tools, and more

## What is MCP?

The Model Context Protocol lets you build servers that expose data and functionality to LLM applications in a secure, standardized way. It provides a uniform way to connect LLMs to resources they can use. MCP servers can:

- Expose functionality through `Tools` (execute code or produce side effects)
- Expose data through `Resources` (load information into the LLM's context)
- Define interaction patterns through `Prompts` (reusable templates for LLM interactions)
- And more!

mcp-agent provides a high-level, Pythonic interface for building agents that leverage these MCP servers.

## Why mcp-agent?

There are too many AI frameworks out there already. But `mcp-agent` is the only one that is purpose-built for a shared protocol - [MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction). It is also the most lightweight, and is closer to an agent pattern library than a framework.

As [more services become MCP-aware](https://github.com/punkpeye/awesome-mcp-servers), you can use mcp-agent to build robust and controllable AI agents that can leverage those services out-of-the-box.

  mcp-agent provides the shortest path from idea to production. Deploy locally, to mcp-agent cloud, or to your own infrastructure.
