## Overview

`MCPApp` is the central application context that manages configuration, logging, MCP server connections, and execution engines.

```python
from mcp_agent.app import MCPApp

app = MCPApp(name="my_agent_app")

async with app.run() as mcp_agent_app:
    logger = mcp_agent_app.logger
    # Your agent code here
```

## Decorators

MCPApp provides decorators for exposing agents and workflows as MCP tools:

- `@app.tool` - Expose a function as an MCP tool
- `@app.async_tool` - Expose an async function as an MCP tool
- `@app.workflow` - Define a workflow class
- `@app.workflow_task` - Define individual workflow tasks
